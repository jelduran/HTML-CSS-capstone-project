### Description

Building a directory inspired by the project Patashule. This time I decided to create a similar project but based on searching for gyms. All the names, logos and imagery are fictional. The project displays the following features:

1. Responsive.
2. Breakpoints for small, medium and big screens.
3. Use flexbox for layout.
4. Main page (search page), with a link to the results page.
5. Search results page, with a list of gyms each with a link to the detail gym page.
6. Detail gyms page.
